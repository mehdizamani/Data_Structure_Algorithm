A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline,
he decides to cancel class if fewer than some number of students are present when class starts.
Arrival times go from on time (arrivalTime<=0) to arrived late (arrivalTime>0).

Given the arrival time of each student and a threshhold number of attendees, determine if the class is canceled.
Sample Input

2
4 3
-1 -3 4 2
4 2
0 -1 2 1
Sample Output

YES
NO

string angryProfessor(int k, vector<int> a) {
    sort(a.begin(),a.end());
    vector<int>::iterator it=upper_bound(a.begin(),a.end(),0);   // important upper_bound in case of -2,-1,0, 4 gives 4 but lower bound give 0
    if (it == a.end()) // everybody came ontime  // important in case of -3,-1, -1 , all values are negative and it gives a.end not null!!!
        return "NO";
    else
    {
        if (k >  (it-a.begin()) ) // rhs :people who came ontime  // the it-a.begin() is integer!!!
            return "YES";
    }
    return "NO";

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, 
and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have. 
You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters.
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0

class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string J, string S) {
    
        // speed 67% and space 30%
        unordered_map<int, int>  m;
        int sum=0;
        for(auto i: J)
            m[i]++;
        for(auto i: S)
            if(m.find(i) != m.end())
                sum ++;
        return sum;
    }
};
